# Artificer

## Overview
This is a monorepo for my lab. It is designed to be a one stop shop for all of my projects, whether that be software, hardware, or both.

## Philosophy
I wanted a single repository for keeping all of my projects, whether large or small. Too often I simply create a new repo for a thing I want to do, and leave all of my old code from previous projects behind. Not anymore. This repo will serve as a central location for all of my future projects, with proper architecture to handle better versioning and reuse of code throughout its lifetime. 

Its designed to challenge the norms. Too often in the industry am I forced to go along with the design or implementation laid down by the company or software architect. This repo serves as a monument to their sins. To challenge the traditional trenches that I am forced to walk, and see if "we can do better". Some paradigms will survive, but I want to see which ones dont.

Finally, its designed to be shared. I want my friends, family, and complete strangers to benefit from what I create, if I am able to create it well. I want others to benefit from my creations here.
